## Architecture Decisions

### Why These App Names?

| App | Purpose | Why This Name? |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| `accounts` | Auth UX (signup/login/logout) | We use Django's built-in User — `accounts` signals "auth actions", not "user model ownership" |
| `clubs` | Club CRUD | Self-explanatory |
| `memberships` | User↔Club relationships, roles, requests | Separate from `clubs` for SRP — complex domain (roles, requests, permissions) |
| `posts` | Blog/News content | Self-explanatory |

### Key Design Choices

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Custom User model? | **No** | MVP scope; Django's User is sufficient |
| Multiple club membership? | **Yes** | Realistic; `Membership` M2M-through handles it |
| Database | **PostgreSQL** | Production-ready, Docker-friendly |

### Model Ownership

| Model | App | Fields |
|-------|-----|--------|
| `Club` | clubs | name, description, created_by (FK→User), created_at, slug |
| `Membership` | memberships | user (FK→User), club (FK→Club), role (ADMIN/MODERATOR/MEMBER), joined_at |
| `MembershipRequest` | memberships | user (FK→User), club (FK→Club), status (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED), requested_at, reviewed_by (FK→User, nullable) |
| `Post` | posts | title, body, post_type (BLOG/NEWS), club (FK→Club), author (FK→User), created_at, is_published |

### Import Rules (No Circular Imports)

```
clubs      → imports nothing from project apps
memberships → imports Club from clubs
posts      → imports Club from clubs, helpers from memberships
accounts   → imports nothing from project apps
```
